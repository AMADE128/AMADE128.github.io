							<h1>About me</h1>
							<p>I'm a recently graduated designer who's starting it's journey in the videogame industry. I've spent 4 years learning about programming, design and 3d art, finally deciding to specialize in the design ambit. While I love developing and various brances of the design, I've also spent a lot of time doing 3d, more as a hobby to practice my skills as a modeler, but has also helped me throughout the proccess, and even got a few jobs as a 3rd party modeler.
								My hobbies are, of course, videogames, being my favorite ones the Trine saga, Project Zomboid and CIV VI. I've been diving into the TTRPGS in my latest years, and I'm currently DMing some D&D campaigns in a homebrew world I plan on developing further, just for the sake of learning worldbuilding and having fun. While not online, I spent most of my time hiking or practicing calisthenics. I've also been a monitor working with kids for almost 5 years total.
