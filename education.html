							<p>Bachelors Degree Graduate in Design and Development of Videogames. During this 4-year career, I learned in the fields of programming and design as well as 3d, as well as the use of the most used engines such as Unity or Unreal5, as well as learning to program in C, C++ and C#.

							<h1>Experience</h1>
							<h2>Dungeon Dome</h2>
							<span class="image"><img src="images/ddome.png" alt="" /></span></p>
							<p>An independent project, currently on-going, with a small team of students/ recently graduated. In DungeonDome, players create, build and train procedurally generated characters from a vast database of options. These characters join companies that explore dungeons crafted by illusionist magicians for the delight of the public. The survivors of these perilous dungeons earn the right to compete against other teams in the DungeonDome, the ultimate dungeon challenge. Each of the events that occur in the game are recorded to feed the personal diary of each character, in a complete and novel procedural narrative system.
